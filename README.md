Simple mDNS scan on Android

Please feel free to laugh at this and provide suggestions how to do it properly, only been learning Kotlin/Android for a few days, but I got interested 
when I saw how much easier it was to do UI with Jetpack Compose so I thought I'd have a go.

mDNS library is https://github.com/andriydruk/RxDNSSD

Also, main hint about how to do it was here : https://medium.com/p/c59362fd843e
